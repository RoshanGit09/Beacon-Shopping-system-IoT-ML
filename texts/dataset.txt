The data is organized into two main categories: cereals and grain legumes. Each category contains several types of food alongside their nutritional information, including various amino acid contents.

In the cereals category, the food items listed include different forms of wheat such as whole wheat, bulgur, semolina, vermicelli, and roasted vermicelli. Each entry provides a food code, the number of regions the food is prevalent in, and specific values for amino acids like Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Cystine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine. For example, whole wheat has six regions of prevalence and exhibits specific values for each of the amino acids.

Moving to the grain legumes category, items such as Bengal gram (both dal and whole), black gram (dal and whole), various types of field beans, and green gram are included. Each entry similarly notes the food code, regions, and the amino acid contents. For instance, Bengal gram dal shows significant values for several amino acids and is also prevalent in six regions.

This format provides a structured overview and allows for easy comparison between different food items based on their amino acid profiles and regional availability.

The data includes various food items, along with their respective codes, names, number of regions, and contents of certain phytochemicals. 

The first item listed is the brown-skinned potato, scientifically known as Solanum tuberosum, with the code F007, found in one region. It contains a noteworthy amount of myricetin at 2.84 mg, along with trace amounts of other substances like Hesperetin and Daidzein.

Following this, the red-skinned potato (F008), also belonging to the Solanum tuberosum species, is noted to have the same myricetin content of 2.84 mg, indicating a similarity in nutritional profile with the brown-skinned variety.

The elongate red-skinned radish, identified by code F009 and classified as Raphanus sativus, is found in three regions but does not list any specific phytochemical contents. 

Also listed is the elongate white-skinned radish (F010), which has a broader presence in six regions, yet like its red counterpart, it contains no specified phytochemicals.

The round red-skinned radish (F011) is another variety from Raphanus sativus, also located in one region and lacking detailed phytochemical data.

The dataset also includes the round white-skinned radish (F012), which appears in two regions but, similar to the others, carries no specific information regarding phytochemicals.

Moving on, the sweet potato varieties show some variability in phytochemical content. The brown skin variety, coded F013, is found in four regions and lists a minimal amount of Quercetin-3-β-galactoside at 0.03±0.01 mg. 

The pink-skinned sweet potato (F014) has been noted to contain slightly higher amounts at 0.06±0.02 mg and is reported across three regions.

Tapioca (F015), also referred to scientifically as Manihot esculenta, is recorded as being present in three regions but does not specify any phytochemical content.

The water chestnut, known as Eleocharis dulcis (F016), is another food item present in one region with no recorded phytochemicals.

The elephant yam (F017) shows a presence across six regions, while the ordinary yam (F018) is noted in four regions; both do not list any specific phytochemicals.

The wild yam (F019) is documented in two regions, again lacking phytochemical content. 

The data addresses various condiments and spices, starting with the section labeled 'CONDIMENTS AND SPICES-FRESH', which indicates no specific phytochemical information.

Included here are different varieties of green chillies. The first, green chilli-1 (G001), known scientifically as Capsicum annuum, is found in five regions, but there is no specified phytochemical data.

The second variety, green chilli-2 (G002), appears in three regions and similarly does not provide phytochemical specifics.

Green chilli-3 (G003) is listed in five regions, while green chilli-4 (G004) is present in three, with no records of phytochemical content in either case.

Finally, green chilli-5 (G005) is noted to exist in two regions, again without any detailed phytochemical information.
